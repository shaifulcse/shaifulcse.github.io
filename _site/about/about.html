  <h2>Software Energy Models</h2>
  <h3><p>Measuring Software energy requires expensive tools and expertise---a far cry for most individual developers.
My research focuses on developing machine learning based software energy consumption models, that can estimate energy consumption
without any hardware instrumentation. Please check our EMSE and MSR papers (GreenScaler and GreenOracle). </p></h3>

  <h2>Software Energy Efficiency</h2>
  <h3><p>While an energy model can help in estimating software energy consumption, developers need guidelines on writing and 
deploying energy efficient systems. Please check our SANER 2016 paper where we compare the energy efficiency of HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 for mobile clients. Also, our EMSE logging paper shows the cost of software logging and some potential energy efficient logging techniques. We are currently working on examples of energy efficient coding (e.g., bundling events). </p></h3>

  <h2>Mining Software Repositories</h2>
  <h3><p>MSR is an approach to help software developers by mining and extracting knowledge from existing enormous amount of information (code repositories from GitHub for example). I particularly enjoy this field because of its inherent relation with machine learning and data mining. Please check our MSR challenge paper where we show how we can use StackOverflow questions/answers, and YouTube video comments for building classifiers that can identify if a discussion is about programming or not-programming. </p></h3>
